**2. Introduction**

     This program is designed to read PDF files and extract value from the tables inside the file. I used Java Regular Expression class 
     to retrieve value from the tables, by using pattern and matcher method from Java Regex class. Objectives of the program included finding
     the total number of certain value, duration of date, and basic comparison between values. 5 threads are used to perform all the analysis.
